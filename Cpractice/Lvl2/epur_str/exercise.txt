Write a program that takes a string, and displays this string with exactly one
space between words, with no spaces or tabs either at the beginning or the end,
followed by a \n.

A "word" is defined as a part of a string delimited either by spaces/tabs, or
by the start/end of the string.

If the number of arguments is not 1, or if there are no words to display, the
program displays \n.

Examples:

$./a.out "It's a rainy day" | cat -e
It's a rainy day$

$ ./a.out " HEY          hey      Cpractice " | cat -e
HEY hey Cpractice$
$

$> ./a.out "" | cat -e
$
$>
