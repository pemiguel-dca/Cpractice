Write a program that takes a string and displays this string after rotating it
one word to the left.

Thus, the first word becomes the last, and others stay in the same order.

A "word" is defined as a part of a string delimited either by spaces/tabs, or
by the start/end of the string.

Words will be separated by only one space in the output.

If there's less than one argument, the program displays \n.
 
Example:

$>./rostring "cbd   " | cat -e
cbd$
$>

$>./rostring "I love the      Sunny days"
love the Sunny days I
$>

$>./rostring | cat -e
$
$>
